## Desires Sated

### *from* **The Garden**

---

Rejoice for it has already started \
The first bloom you were so eager to see \
Butterflies and bees hum their jubilee \
In the melody of desires sated

Its fruition is what you have coveted \
Though the sabotage may forbidden be \
A longing, no more an apostrophe \
A wish no longer taken for granted
