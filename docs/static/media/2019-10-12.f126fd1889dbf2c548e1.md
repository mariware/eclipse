## Delicate Buds

### *from* **The Garden**

---

Your flower buds in my garden \
Unveiling petals of chiffon \
Roots 'neath the ground I'm dancing on \
It caused my morning to brighten

Once I asked a playful marten \
"Have you seen this flower somewhere?" \
The creature gave me an answer \
Words impossible to harken
