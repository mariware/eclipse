## Where My Heart Resides

### *from* **Windtalker**

---

I am lost. \
I tried to wander, \
fly like the birds I \
used to watch while \
I was bored from \
looking at the sky. \
You were invisible.

Much like love,
your existence \
was meant to be felt. \
It must be exciting \
to live like you. \
I tried to wonder. \
Find meâ€”

I knew you'd find me. \
There is only one \
place that I would go, \
where my heart resides \
is what you call home.
