## The Voice A While Back

### Pair: Juyeon / Changmin | Word Count: 3634

---

**Excerpt:** The voice a while back has already disappeared but its echoes still remain on the corridors and in Juyeon’s heart. If sound waves could come in the shape of an arrow, it has probably pierced through Juyeon’s chest. Juyeon seeks the person that has inflicted this wound on him.
