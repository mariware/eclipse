## From Giverny

### *from* **The Garden**

---

As I was wond'ring what I'll be getting \
I remember paintings of Monet \
Of flowers in single stalks and bouquet \
Charming enough to leave me daydreaming

Then suddenly my thoughts are escaping \
Flying like swans of Western ballet \
I amble from this unpleasant getaway \
To my doorstep where I see you waiting
