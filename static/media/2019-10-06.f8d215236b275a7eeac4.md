## The Lost Flower

### *from* **The Garden**

---

The orchid is born on the air \
It rests its roots on the unseen \
Making a clandestine ravine \
The young buds of our love affair

An orchid burgeons in my lungs \
Enough to suffocate me clean \
Lost in my organs; it has been \
Keeping our heartstings unstrung
