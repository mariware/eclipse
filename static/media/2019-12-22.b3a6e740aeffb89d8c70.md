## Wander Weary

### *from* **The Garden**

---

I dare you to welcome the butterfly \
As if it had travelled through the hectare \
It flaps its wings at every familiar \
Looking for a bedspread to beautify

It will rest, then sing its own lullaby \
Dreaming of flowers and of sweet nectar \
But the butterfly is but a beggar \
With nothing to give aside from goodbye
