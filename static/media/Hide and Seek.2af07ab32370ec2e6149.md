### Pair: Jaehyun / Doyoung | Word Count: 9410

---

**Excerpt:** Happy moments such as this could only go so far. Jaehyun doesn't mistake it when he hears Doyoung afraid of being in relationships. He knows that he's partly to blame, so he takes his place to apologize, "I'm sorry for leaving like that, Doyoungie."

"Please tell me why," Doyoung pleads, "you never said goodbye to me directly." The joy fades from Doyoung's face as it is being replaced by sullen sobriety. His sharp gaze is focused on Jaehyun, cold and emotionless, painful to endure. It's about time Jaehyun confesses the decision he regrets the most.
