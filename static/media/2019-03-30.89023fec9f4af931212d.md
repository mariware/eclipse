## Child of Stardust

### *from* **Etherealities**

---

My mind is a planet \
Revolving in invisible circles \
Around someone else’s sun \
They are my ideal stars \
The constellation of my thoughts \
But my moon will always be mine

My heart is as frail \
As crystal glass \
Filled with scratches \
From its past thieves \
But it was never stolen \
Because I gave it to them

I did it before, once or twice \
I do not remember \
But I am doing it again \
This time to you, to a stranger \
Who has never seen my soul \
Or anything beneath my skin

I offer my senses that I may \
See you in the darkest nights \
And hear you in the silence of it \
Feel you beyond my bones \
Into the blood in my veins \
To be with you, I cannot do

In spite of all that I can give \
The universe will redeem you \
Child of stardust, you’re not mine \
You belong to the heavens \
That I never see when I look up \
Still, I dedicate my words to you

My lungs are weak \
But for you I will speak \
Without breathing \
Words will come out \
Out from my mouth \
Without pause —

I need you.
