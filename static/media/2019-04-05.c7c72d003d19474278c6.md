## To The Angel

### *from* **Etherealities**

---

I know that love does not discriminate \
Between who are sinners and who are saints \
Dreamy are the stories it can narrate \
Beauteous are the pictures that it paints

I asked God for a lover, I found you \
An angel with ethereal comeliness \
I canâ€™t put to words how much I love you \
Your effulgence have me rendered speechless

You are the orison that I shall pray \
The blessing I hope for in all my days \
Cover me with your wings so that I may \
Feel the warmth of your heart in your embrace \
For whatever happens, your mark will stay \
In my mind, you shall have a special place
