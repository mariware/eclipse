I know you are chasing a leaf back to its flower. I cannot meet you today but I suppose you could give me a fruit when I do.

How justifiably poetic that it rains whenever you are gone. I close my window so the sky's tears don't fall on my cheeks â€” I can cry my own. Wipe them before they freeze to sadness. It will be a cold week.
