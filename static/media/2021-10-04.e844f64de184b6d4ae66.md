## Zephyr, I Am Happy

### *from* **Windtalker**

Zephyr, I am happy today. I still wait for you by the window but as the birds sing to me on their bonny branch, I find myself enjoying their merry melody. I am happy today, and saying that alone is enough for my humbled heart.

But of course, I am happier with you. The birds may bring me songs of nature but the song I want to hear is yours. Tell me where did your wanderlust bring you? I always wish your last destination is where I am.

Your visit has made me the happiest. For a moment, I was free of all of my worries. For a moment, I was able to breathe steadily. For a moment, I was very much alive. Zephyr, I hope I had made you happy today too.
