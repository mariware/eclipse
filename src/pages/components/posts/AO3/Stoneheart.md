**Excerpt:** “Johnny, Johnny. My life was filled with Johnny, everything Johnny. That was my fault. I can’t forget him because he already owns a part of my life. Now, it’s going Yootae, Yootae, Yootae. I found out something recently though, and ironically, that is because I had Yootae with me. I don’t have to forget Johnny to forgive him. I just have to forgive myself and believe that I, too, deserve to be happy again. I need to be stronger, not for someone else, but for myself.

“This time, it’s about me.”
