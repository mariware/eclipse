**Excerpt:** “I have a question,” Doyoung interposes, “what do you call a dog without legs?”

Jaehyun found it weird. He expected the question to be about the movie they just watched but as far as he remembers, there weren’t any special dogs there, let alone a dog without legs. He replies with the first thing that entered his mind, “A hotdog?”
