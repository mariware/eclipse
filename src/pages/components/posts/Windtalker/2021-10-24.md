## Storm

### *from* **Windtalker**

---

I waited for the storm, \
the violent whirlwind \
to violate me so vehemently \
that I'd desperately demand \
for your healing. Yet the storm \
was caring instead of cruel, \
charitable in caressing where \
I thought there would be \
wounds. I was safely sure, \
the storm was my friend.

Still the storm is not \
to be compared to you. \
You are the eternal \
cyclone in my Jupiter, \
the red spot smeared in \
my otherwise unblemished body.

I am always in your eye, \
dancing at the edge of \
deathly danger and vowing \
that my longing for you shan't \
subside in this thunderstorm.
