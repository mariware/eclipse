## Withering

### *from* **Windtalker**

---

The light caress of your phantom and my window ajar. I could let you in and you would come, but there is nothing that I could offer your spirit. I will not siphon life out of you to extend mine, so let us stay this way, but not until death divides us.

I will call your name, embrace you so tight my arms wrap around my chest. Feel your existence as if it is also mine. Please be there. Without you, I am a body with a severed soul.
