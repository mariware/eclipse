## Spring's Renewal

### *from* **Windtalker**

It is that time of the season, isn't it? I know by the pollen grains that you have not left me entirely, though we have parted for longer than usual. By the time you come back, new flowers would have bloomed. I shall tell you what their bud looked like before they blossomed.

The memory will be rooted in my mind until my hope sustains them. I beg of you to make your return before I forget. I am only as patient as leaves on an autumn day.
