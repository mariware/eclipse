## Monsoon

### *from* **Windtalker**

It has been five days since. Now my bed is a doldrum and I a ship unmoving in the shallowness of my sheets. My electric fan is at its fastest setting, air so humid that it is stifling. But I let my skin run dry, for that's the only way I'll realize the worth of your comfort.

It rained today. The October wind is cold on the wet patches of my skin. Perhaps the sky is telling me to close my window, or perhaps you'll come and warm me just the same.
