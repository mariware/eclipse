## The Garden

### *from* **The Garden**

---

To the sun, the flowers, the pouring rain \
This an idyll I write and dedicate \
A symbol of love compassionate \
For the one I like, a glass of champagne

For all things fruitful and for all things vain \
This an idyll I write to show my faith \
Be it a month or a year, I will wait \
Time will be lost but the love will remain
