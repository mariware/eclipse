## The Starlight Paramour

### *from* **Etherealities**

---

The heavens cry comets \
Staining lines of cream \
Bending the cursed axis \
To which our minds rotate

Stars sprinkled in darkness \
Lighting the hidden pathway \
My lost emotions hoping \
To find their rightful place

The aurora will be my blanket \
As I sleep through hues of blue \
Envelope my feeble self \
Dreaming all about you

The nebula is smoke \
The galaxies mirrors \
The mirage of our souls \
The promise of future

I wake to a supernova \
Of a million exploding stars \
Others go just the same \
In wait for their own time

I am bound to fate \
Pledged to the universe \
Orion is my guard \
To prevent my escape

In sullen thought I admit \
The fault in our skies \
They are never eternal \
Once burned in our sight

But a moment could last \
Forever as one desires \
All planets will align \
To see it in its glory

The sand I leave today \
Make the hourglass of the past \
The parallax is my way \
And Iâ€™m never coming back

I am meeting the noble-born \
Who calls for my presence \
The stars will cross our meeting \
Putting our love in between
