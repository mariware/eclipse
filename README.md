# ECLIPSE

Eclipse is a personal blog containing all my literary and artistic works. This project is bootstrapped with Create React App and uses various JavaScript libraries to achieve an overall ecliptical aesthetic. This site is a Machine Project done in partial fullfilment of the requirements of the CMSC 110 course. The blog has four main parts: the sun, the moon, the earth, and the eclipse.

### It has started.
## The Eclipse

The eclipse is the homepage. In order for the other parts to be revealed, the eclipse must first occur. This is done by fully hovering the cursor on the circle, thus casting a shadow on the celestial outline. The "I" on the eclipse represents me, the creator. Upon clicking, it will reveal to a different page containing a picture of mine and a short description. Additionally, it is a portal to the other parts of the blog.

## The Sun
### There is a person who reminds me of the sunlit hours. This is a collection of prose and poems dedicated to *him*.

The sun is a compilation of my short-form literary works. Most of these works have already been posted, one way or another, in my own personal pages such as my Twitter account and my old blog (Etherealities). The first sun contains works from "Windtalker." Windtalker is a florilegium of poems dedicated to *my wind*, the person I love. It is a series about our rarest interactions with one another. The second sun contains works from "Etherealities". These are works that I have taken from my old blog which I think are still worth reading. The third and last sun contains works from "The Garden". The Garden was first an alternative universe before I have turned it to an anthology of poems; it is a story of two lovers whose love lingered like the season of spring.

## The Moon
### There are people who remind me of the moonlit hours. This is a collection of artworks dedicated to them.

The moon is a gallery of my artworks. Each artwork is dedicated to a person whom I admire. Each row of drawings has its own theme. My other artworks are posted in my Instagram account which can be accessed through the link in the footer.

## The Earth
### There are fated pairs who live under the same sky as I do. This is a collection of stories dedicated to *them*.

The earth is a selection of my own short stories that I have written under the pseudonym of *Whiteflower*. These stories are in the form of fanfiction based on Korean idols. The stories are cross-posted in my Archive of Our Own (AO3) account. Each story is linked in their own panel and may be read by going to the AO3 site.

## Miscellaneous Details

### Animation

Most of the animation in this site was done using the GSAP library. The GSAP libray allows for animation to be done in the JS files instead of the CSS files. Additioanlly, it allows customization of effects which help streamline the process of reusing them.

### Rendering

Since this site is bootstrapped with Create React App, it is largely based on React. React allows interfaces to be done by combining components. In this project, instead of multiple HTML files, there are multiple JS files to represent each of the pages. Through the rendering process, these JS files produce HTML elements using the various coded components. The pages and components are stored in their respective folder as well as the additional files used in creating the website.

### Content

A large portion of the text content in this site is written in MarkDown. MarkDown allows easy rendering of text files, such as this, into HTML elements using equivalent formatting styles. The MarkDown files are fetched individually and are rendered using a React Component. The React Component is then used to generate a 'feed' that shows the content of the MarkDown files.

### How To Run

To run this project, npm is required. In the project directory, using `npm start` runs it in a development mode and it will be shown in a local server from the browser.
